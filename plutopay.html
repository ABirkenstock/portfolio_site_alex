                    <p>In order to better understand this industry and find out where the product currently fits within the market, I conducted a competitor analysis.

                        I focused on companies with a similar target market: Banking and Wallet Apps with a social aspect.
                        Examples of two of the Competitors PayPal and Venmo</p>

                <h3>User Interviews</h3>

                <p>In Order to better understand the pain points of potential users and current state of the market, I interviewed people from a wide array of backgrounds, genders and age ranges. I asked the participants about their habits around banking and wallet apps to better understand:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>• What functions, outside of payment, are the most important functions for fi- nance/wallet apps?</li>
                    <li>• Which apps or services are currently being used to facilitate payments and so on by customers and why?</li>
                    <li>• What concerns do people have when using finance appsThe Insights from the Interviews could be grouped into four groups:</li>
                    <li>• Paying habits  </li>
                    <li>• Wanted/missing Features</li>
                    <li>• Trust Issues</li>
                    <li>• Bank IssuesThese Insights would become the fundamental building blocks for creating the design.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>From this I created the:</p>

                <h3>Card Sorting and Sitemaps</h3>

                <p>Once I had a solid list of requirements for the new design, I conducted a card sorting session, to get a better grasp of how users expect the content to be organized.During the card sorting session, I asked participants to organize tasks into categories, which they had to come up by themselves.
I used a similarity matrix to interpret the data, which illustrates the relationships between the categorized task. Additionally, an agreement dendrogram was employed to showcase the level of consensus among participants. This shows the preferred content organization.
                </p>
               
                <p>Overall, this exercise proved to be instrumental in refining our understanding of users’ perspectives and informed our design decisions accordingly when creating the sitemap:
                </p>

                <h2>Prototype</h2>
                <p>The next hurdle was to transform the flows into practical wireframes. This crucial step involved distilling all the data into meaningful information that users could easily digest. My aim was to create an effortless and hassle-free experience when it came to navigation and finding information.To achieve this, I had to keep the number of screens to a minimum. This meant creating numerous wireframe variations, where different features and functions were combined, in order to determine which ones performed better than others.I was aware of the potential of overwhelming the user. Balancing this concern, I strove to minimize the risk without compromising any essential features or critical information. It was a delicate balancing act to ensure a user-friendly experience while retaining the necessary functionality.</p>

                <h3>Usability Tests</h3>
                <p>During the usability testing phase, a series of carefully planned tests were conducted to assess the effectiveness, efficiency, and overall user experience of our design. Real users were engaged in interactive sessions, where they performed specific tasks and provided valuable feedback. The tests helped identify pain points, usability issues, and areas for improvement, allowing us to iterate and refine the design to ensure optimal usability and user satisfaction. The insights gathered from these tests were invaluable in guiding our decision-making and ultimately enhancing the usability of our product.</p>
                <h3>Preference Test</h3>
                <img src="" alt=""><!--find image-->
                <p>For details between screens and design related questions that arose from the user tests, I conducted a few small preference tests to gain larger, more quantitive data.<br>
                    Like in this example, two users during the user tests mentioned they weren’t quite happy with how the name of the app and the dashboard header were handled. So I created this preference test to see which version users prefer.</p>

                     <p>Next, I reworked the prototypes with the feedback from the user tests in mind. I also developed a design language system to set fonts, colors, logos and other visual material.</p>
                     <p>This Document serves as a guide for other designer to understand the design language, so anyone will be able to create design for this app.</p>

                    <p>This project has been an incredibly fulfilling journey for me as a designer. By prioritizing user needs and applying design thinking methodologies, I have created a wallet app, PlutoPay, that truly simplifies financial management and brings joy to users.</p>
